I'm happy to announce that my paper "A statistical theory for optimal decision making in sports betting" is about to be 
published in the peer-reviewed journal PLoS ONE. 

This paper is a long-time coming for me, representing a bucket list item of sorts. I have long been fascinated with the 
statistics of sports betting. 

Link to the the [git repo][optimal-betting-theory] containing source code to reproduce the paper's analysis.

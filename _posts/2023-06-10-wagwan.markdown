I'm happy to announce that my paper "A statistical theory for optimal decision making in sports betting" is about to be 
published in the peer-reviewed journal PLoS ONE.

This paper is something like a bucket list item for me, as I have long been fascinated with the 
math of sports betting. As a child in the early 90s, I remember walking to the corner store to 
pick up the paper menu for "Sports Action", the provincial sports lottery in British Columbia.
I suspect that it may be more difficult for children to place wagers in present times. 
Somewhere along the way, I realized that betting in sports is just a problem of statistical estimation -- albeit a very
noisy and perhaps even chaotic one. The development presented in the paper came about over several
years (evenings and weekends) of having the key equations crystallize in my mind. My hope is that
the paper helps the astute sports bettor and piques the interest of those who enjoy interesting
problems in applied statistics.

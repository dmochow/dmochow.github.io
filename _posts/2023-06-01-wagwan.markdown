Welcome to my _personal_ website. 

In the broadest sense, my objective is to contribute content that is beneficial to someone other than me.

I've refrained from having any sort of a web presence over the last several years, taking the
viewpoint that I would only create a website 

For the last several years, I have not had much of a web presence. This was a conscious decision
reflecting: 
- my observations about scientific and research lab websites, and
- my appraisal of the value of my past research

A former labmate of mine at Stanford University once made what I consider an ingenious comment about scientific 
journals whose impact factor is less than 1: "they are making science worse!" 

I have a similar view about the various scientific research webpages that are routinely made by principal 
investigators and postdocs: rarely do I feel that what is shown is serving (or even aiming to serve)
the readership (that's you!). Rather, they are an expression of research output

Let me be the first to say: I am not the most prolific 

To expand on the latter bullet, 


This is a _personal_ website.

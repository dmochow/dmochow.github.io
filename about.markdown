I was born in Gdansk, Poland and lived in the same apartment complex as [Lech Walesa][lech].

My Dad was a mechanical engineer and managed to move our family to Canada on a post-doctoral fellowship from the Canadian
government in the late 1980s. After growing up and eventually doing my graduate studies in electrical engineering in Canada, that same
post-doctoral fellowship program allowed me to move to the United States thirty years later to pursue my interests in the brain.
I am now an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the [City College of New York][ccny] (currently
on sabbatical) and also the VP of Machine Learning at [Optios][optios], where I am contributing to the development
of next-generation neurotechnologies that leverage advances in artificial intelligence. 

But I'm not the type of researcher that is happy to be confined to a single domain or scientific problem, and I tend to 
switch problems more frequently than what is optimal for traditional career advancement. This brings me to the primary 
reason for creating this minimalistic, non-narcissistic, somewhat infrequently updated website: to share with you 
findings and discoveries that I believe could be beneficial to the general population. 

My current scientific interests are in the intersection of machine learning and human neuroscience, as well as the
statistical theory of sports betting markets.

I was born in Gdansk, Poland and lived in the same apartment complex as [Lech Walesa][lech].

My graduate training is in Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering and was conducted in Canada. I studied the problems of array 
beamforming and acoustic source localization. 

I also received post-doctoral training in Psychology and Biomedical Engineering in the United States.

I am now an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the [City College of New York][ccny] (currently
on sabbatical) and the VP of Machine Learning at [Optios][optios]. 

My current scientific interests are in the intersection of machine learning and human neuroscience, as well as the
statistical theory of sports betting markets.

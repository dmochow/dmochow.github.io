I was born in Gdansk, Poland and lived in the same apartment complex as [Lech Walesa][lech].

My Dad was a mechanical engineer and managed to move our family to Canada on a post-doctoral fellowship from the Canadian
government in the late 1980s. After growing up and doing my graduate studies in electrical engineering in Canada, that same
post-doctoral fellowship program allowed me to move to the United States thirty years later to pursue my interests in the brain.
I am now an Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the [City College of New York][ccny] (currently
on sabbatical) and also the VP of Machine Learning at [Optios][optios], where I am contributing to the development
of next-generation neurotechnologies that leverage advances in artificial intelligence. 

I tend to switch problems more frequently than what is optimal for traditional career advancement. For better or worse, 
I'm just not happy being confined to a single domain or scientific problem. The projects that I will talk about
here will be fairly diverse. The goal of this minimal, non-narcissistic, and somewhat infrequently updated 
site is to share with you findings and resources that you may find interesting or useful for your own work. 

My current scientific interests are in the intersection of machine learning and human neuroscience, as well as the
statistical theory of sports betting markets.
